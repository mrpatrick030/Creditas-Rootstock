Through its P2P Lending/Borrowing dApp, Creditas is a DeFi protocol that aims to address a number of lending and borrowing-related difficulties. Creditas provides platform users with an easy-to-use interface by combining front end, integration, and smart contract technologies in a powerful way. The Rootstock test network is the foundation of Creditas.
Yes, your data and assets on the platform are safe and only accessible by you with a wallet or email login, but the Creditas dashboard makes it easy to access the platform's dApp.


## Features of Creditas
This platform features a robust combination of smart contracts and front end and integration tools ranging from a P2P Lending/Borrowing dApp, a Dashboard, wallet and email login (using Web3Modal x Ethers.js), decentralised chat in the lending dApp, documentation, Filebase storage, search functionalities, paginations, flaticons library, and an intuitive interface with a slick responsive design and smooth user experience.

To connect wallet, go to our [Web App](https://Creditasdapp.vercel.app). For desktop, click on the "Connect Wallet" button on the upper right of the screen and choose your login method either with wallet or email. If you don't have a wallet installed already, the wallet connect window has links to download a wallet of your choice on your device's browser (Brave browser, Google Chrome, Opera browser, or Yandex browser all work fine). On mobile, simply download your desired EVM-compatible wallet and use its inbuilt browser to connect to Creditas. Connect your wallet by clicking on the "Connect wallet" button on the upper right of the screen. Ensure to change network to Rootstock test network from the wallet connect window. The display on the screen will change after connecting (typically, it shows your tRBTC balance and a substring of your connected wallet address).

With Creditas being deployed currently on the testnet of Rootstock, testnet tRBTC is required to pay for gas fees during transactions. Testnet tRBTC can be obtained from the [Rootstock testnet faucet](https://faucet.rootstock.io/).

### Web app homepage
The homepage of the Creditas's web app is the first page you see when you visit the app. It is the gateway to Creditas's dashboard and features the wallet connect button as well as other important information about the platform including documentation.

 ### The Creditas Dashboard
This is the most functional part of Creditas. It houses the most important parts of the platform including User's Balances, Metrics and the P2P Lending/Borrowing dApp.

### User's Balances

This section of the dashboard shows all the balances of a user after logging in. It displays the following info for a user: ULT balance, ULT price, tRBTC balance, number of loans you created, number of loans you funded.

### Metrics
![File](https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/QmNYspNFfUD1zb2xErbZFkdmn3wv8SV1sh38i9W1THkeGp)
The metrics section shows live updates to Creditas including the following: ULT Total Supply, ULT Price, Protocol Blockchain, Total number of Loans, Max Loan Amount, Min Loan Amount, contract addresses of all contracts used by the protocol and Live BTC market chart.


### P2P Lend/Borrow dApp
Our users are able to participate in unique P2P lending/borrowing activities of supported tokens. Firstly, a loan has to be created by the borrower using the "Create Loan" button in the Borrow section, then another user (the lender) funds the loan by lending to the borrower using the "Fund Loan" button in the Lend section. The loan has the following characteristics: loan amount, interest, expiry date, and collateral. Collateral provided by the borrower is locked up by the system until the given duration expires, and can be claimed back if there is no lender after the duration of the loan using the "Withdraw Funds" button in the Borrow section of the dApp. Borrowed tokens can also be claimed using the "Withdraw Funds" button. The collateral is sent out to the lender if the borrower fails to repay the loan during the specified time using the "Claim Collateral" button in the Lend section. When you lend on Creditas, you get rewarded hugely according to the agreed terms of the loan (your funds are secured with our security algorithm). When you borrow from Creditas P2P, ensure to present a collateral and pay back with interest when you repay the amount using the "Repay Loan" button in the Borrow section. For a better user experience, a "view all available loans section" and "view your loans section" with search functionality and pagination have been integrated into the dApp for lenders to navigate between loans. A decentralised chat has also been integrated for lenders and borrowers to effectively communicate, all while maintaining privacy. Participate in Creditas DAO governance to determine the next supported token/collateral. 


### Creditas Token (ULT)
The Creditas token (ULT) is the native token of Creditas and is used as a collateral for lending. Other tokens available as collaterals currently are USDT and DAI. 

## Additional Notes
In future upgrades of this project, more dApp features/services will be integrated. We are also focussed on user experience.
